Computer science Ph.D. stipend holder at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) and Fraunhofer Research Center Machine Learning. I am interested in the intersection of ML and computer security. 
In particular, **robustness** and **trustworthiness** of deep neural networks.
My key research interest is the **analysis of adversarial examples** on DNN.

I am advised by  [Janis Keuper](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/hpc/staff/janis-keuper.html)  and supervised by [Ullrich KÃ¶the](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/ullrich-koethe). I am an external Ph.D. student at the University of Heidelberg  ([2nd best-ranked German university](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/germany)).

**News:  I am looking for a research position and  I also willing to immigrate to the USA.**
