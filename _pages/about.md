Computer science Ph.D. stipend holder at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) and Fraunhofer Research Center Machine Learning. I am interested in the intersection of ML and computer security.
I was advised by  [Janis Keuper](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/hpc/staff/janis-keuper.html)  and supervised by [Ullrich KÃ¶the](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/ullrich-koethe). I am an external Ph.D. student at the University of Heidelberg  ([2nd best-ranked German university](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/germany)).

In particular, **robustness** and **trustworthiness** of deep neural networks. 
My key research interest is the **analysis of adversarial examples** on DNN. 

I also had the opportunity to intern with Professor Sijia Liu ([MSU](https://engineering.msu.edu/faculty/Sijia-Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/) & [MIT-IBM](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/sijia-liu/)) and Pin-Yu Chen ([MIT-IBM](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/home)), focusing on adversarial machine learning.
Our paper titled "Visual Prompting for Adversarial Robustness" achieved recognition within the top 3%.
