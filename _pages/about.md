Computer science Ph.D. stipend holder at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) and Fraunhofer Research Center Machine Learning. I am interested in the intersection of ML and computer security. In particular, **robustness** and **trustworthiness** of deep neural networks.

I am advised by  [Janis Keuper](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/hpc/staff/janis-keuper.html)  and supervised by [Ullrich Köthe](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/ullrich-koethe). I am an external Ph.D. student at the University of Heidelberg  ([2nd best-ranked German university](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/germany)).

I am interested in the intersection of ML and computer security. In particular, the robustness and trustworthiness of deep neural networks. My key research interest is the analysis of adversarial attacks on DNN.


**News: I am looking for an internship possibility.**
