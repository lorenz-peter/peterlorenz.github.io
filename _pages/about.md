Computer science Ph.D. stipend holder at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) and Fraunhofer Research Center Machine Learning. I am interested in the intersection of ML and computer security. In particular, **robustness** and **trustworthiness** of deep neural networks.

I am advised by  [Janis Keuper](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/hpc/staff/janis-keuper.html)  and supervised by [Ullrich Köthe](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/ullrich-koethe). I am an external Ph.D. student at the University of Heidelberg  ([2nd best-ranked German university](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/germany)).

I am interested in the intersection of ML and computer security. In particular, the robustness and trustworthiness of deep neural networks. My key research interest is the analysis of adversarial attacks on DNN.


**News: I am looking for an internship possibility.**

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
