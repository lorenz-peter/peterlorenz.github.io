# How to improve your writing?

1. Be concise!
2. Sentences to sentences should be coherent.
3. Write first in your own simple words.

- Keep sentences short and simple.
- Learn a scientific vocabulary.
- Use tools such as ChatGPT or https://www.deepl.com/write to rewrite your sentence.
- Use tools to check your spelling and grammar, e.g. Grammarly or LanguageTool.

4. Section to section should be coherent.

- Check if the discussion section and conclusion match together.
